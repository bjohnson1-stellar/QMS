Extraction Approach:
  1. Classify drawing type (Detail)
  2. Identify all detail callouts
  3. Extract detail titles, numbers, and scales
  4. Capture descriptive text and notes
  5. Extract specification tables (pipe saddle table)
  6. Record installation requirements and notes
  7. Document insulation specifications

Confidence Scoring Factors:
  - Clear text, readable callouts: +0.2
  - Standard detail format: +0.1
  - Complete notes visible: +0.1
  - Small text, unclear: -0.2
  - Missing information: -0.1

Data Quality:
  - Base confidence: 0.7

Uniqueness Constraints:
  - detail_drawings: UNIQUE(sheet_id, detail_number)
  - Used INSERT OR REPLACE to handle any duplicates

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Review Low-Confidence Details:
   - R5100-9 (Electronic OX) - 0.75
   - R5100-10 (DX Detail) - 0.75
   - R5100-12 (CO2 Charging) - 0.75
   - R5011-9 (Vapor Retarder Tape) - 0.80

2. Follow-Up Actions:
   - Verify emergency pressure control system relief pressure (225 PSIG)
   - Confirm pipe saddle table dimensions against specification
   - Review high-density insert detail notes for fabrication requirements

3. Cross-Reference Opportunities:
   - Verify charging station details against safety procedures
   - Check insulation specifications against project spec sections
   - Validate fire-rated penetration assemblies against code requirements

4. Next Steps:
   - Extract remaining Freshpet refrigeration sheets
   - Build equipment master list from all sheet extractions
   - Create specification compliance matrix
