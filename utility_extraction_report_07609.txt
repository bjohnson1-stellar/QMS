EXTRACTION NOTES & ISSUES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Sheet 689] LIMITED_DETAIL
  Drawing resolution limits detailed schedule reading. Primarily shows piping layout with minimal equipment. More detailed schedules may exist on legend/schedule sheets.
  Confidence: 0.6

[Sheet 690] PARTIAL_EXTRACTION
  Five hot water heaters (HWH1-HWH5) identified from plan view. Equipment schedules not clearly visible at current resolution. Detailed specifications may require higher resolution scan.
  Confidence: 0.75

[Sheet 691] UNCLEAR_TAGS
  Roof equipment tags partially visible (CZ01, CZ02). Equipment type uncertain - may be chillers, cooling towers, or other rooftop units. Equipment schedules not readable at current resolution.
  Confidence: 0.7

STATISTICS
================================================================================

Sheets Processed: 3
Equipment Extracted: 7
Average Quality Score: 0.69
Quality Range: 0.60 - 0.70

================================================================================
ISSUES ENCOUNTERED
================================================================================

1. RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS
   - PDF to PNG conversion at 150 DPI provides good overview but limits
     ability to read detailed equipment schedules and small text
   - Equipment tags on plans are visible but detailed specifications are not
   - Recommendation: Use higher DPI (300+) for schedule-heavy drawings

2. DRAWING TYPE CHARACTERISTICS
   - Sheet 689 (U1161): Partial plan showing primarily piping, minimal equipment
   - Sheet 690 (U1301): Overall plan with equipment locations but schedules unclear
   - Sheet 691 (U1401): Roof plan with equipment outlines but tags partially visible
   - These are plan views, not equipment schedules - need to process legend/
     schedule sheets (U0001) for complete equipment specifications

3. EXTRACTION METHOD
   - Manual vision extraction used due to API authentication limitations
   - Claude Code's vision capabilities can identify equipment locations and tags
   - Full automated extraction would require:
     a) Anthropic API key configuration
     b) Higher resolution images or direct PDF text extraction
     c) Processing of companion schedule sheets with detailed specs

4. CONFIDENCE SCORES
   - Ranged from 0.60 to 0.75
   - Lower confidence reflects uncertainty in equipment details
   - Equipment exists and locations are accurate, but specifications incomplete
        

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Process equipment schedule sheets (U0001 series) to get complete specs
2. For critical equipment, cross-reference with:
   - Mechanical schedules
   - Submittal data
   - Equipment cut sheets
3. Consider re-scanning at higher DPI if original PDFs are low quality
4. Validate equipment tags against mechanical drawings for consistency
5. Future extractions: Use automated pipeline with Anthropic API for:
   - Batch processing
   - Dual-agent cross-checking
   - Automated confidence scoring
