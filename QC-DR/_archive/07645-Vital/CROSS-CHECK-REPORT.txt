DETAILED FINDINGS

CRITICAL CONFLICTS: NONE DETECTED

HIGH CONFLICTS: NONE DETECTED

MEDIUM CONFLICTS:

1. SIZE MISMATCH - Line HTS-RAHU-4
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Impact: Size discrepancy may indicate reducer or extraction error
   Drawing R7002: 2-1/2 inch vs 3 inch
   Material: Refrigerant
   Action: Review drawing R7002 at line HTS-RAHU-4 location

2. MISSING REFERENCE - Instruments on P&IDs
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Impact: 90 instruments on P&IDs not found on Loop diagrams
   Sample: SYS RAHU-11 CV2, CV5, PT3, STR1, TT4
           SYS RAHU-12 CV2, CV5, PT3, STR1, TT4
           (and 70 more...)
   Action: Verify if Loop diagrams exist or instruments do not require loops

3-18. EQUIPMENT TAG CONFLICTS - RAHU Units
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Impact: Multiple equipment type classifications
   Pattern: RAHU units classified as:
     - RAHU (generic tag)
     - Air Handler (equipment type)
     - Cooling Coil (component)
   Affected: RAHU-1 through RAHU-27
   Root Cause: Extraction sees unit and components as separate equipment
   Action: Standardize RAHU as primary type, cooling coil as component


LOW CONFLICTS:

19-25. EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION CONFLICTS - RCU Units
   Severity: LOW
   Impact: Inconsistent descriptions but same equipment type
   Example: RCU-7 as 'Refrigeration Condensing Unit' vs 'EVAPORATIVE CONDENSER'
   Root Cause: Different drawing conventions
   Action: Standardize to 'Refrigeration Condensing Unit [#]' format

26. MISSING REFERENCE - Equipment on Plans Not on P&IDs
   Severity: LOW
   Impact: 7 equipment items on plans but not P&IDs
   Items: HU-1, HU-2, HU-3, HU-5, COND-NORTH, COND-CENTER, COND-SOUTH
   Analysis: May be architectural/HVAC equipment outside process scope
   Action: Verify if P&IDs required


ANALYSIS SUMMARY

Material Conflicts: NONE DETECTED
  - No material mismatches between same line numbers
  - No carbon steel/stainless steel galvanic corrosion risks

Spec Class Conflicts: NONE DETECTED
  - Insufficient spec data for comprehensive analysis

Weld Conflicts: NONE DETECTED
  - No NDE requirement mismatches
  - No weld type conflicts

Cross-Discipline Conflicts: NONE DETECTED
  - No material conflicts between disciplines
  - Limited to single discipline data

Instrument Loop Completeness:
  - 90 instruments on P&IDs not found on loop diagrams (47% missing)
  - HIGHEST PRIORITY ISSUE for investigation


RECOMMENDATIONS

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Medium Priority):

1. Investigate 90 missing instrument loop cross-references
   - Verify if loop diagrams exist but were not extracted
   - Confirm if some instruments do not require loop sheets
   - Cross-reference with I&O lists and electrical drawings

2. Review line HTS-RAHU-4 size discrepancy on R7002
   - Confirm if 2-1/2 inch to 3 inch reducer exists
   - Verify extraction accuracy

3. Standardize RAHU equipment type classification
   - Define whether RAHU refers to complete unit or air handler component
   - Update extraction rules to handle cooling coil as sub-component

SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Low Priority):

4. Standardize RCU equipment descriptions
   - Choose consistent format: 'Refrigeration Condensing Unit [#]'
   - Update drawing standards for future consistency

5. Verify HVAC equipment (HU and COND units) process requirements
   - Determine if P&IDs needed or architectural-only equipment

PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS:

6. Increase extraction coverage from 4.7% to 100%
   - 444 sheets remain unextracted
   - Full analysis requires complete dataset

7. Enhanced Cross-Discipline Checks
   - Once more disciplines extracted, verify:
     * Structural support locations vs pipe routing
     * Electrical power requirements vs instrument needs
     * Civil foundations vs equipment placement


DATA QUALITY NOTES

Extraction Coverage:
  - Only 22 of 466 sheets extracted (4.7%)
  - Primarily refrigeration P&IDs and plans analyzed
  - Limited cross-discipline data available

Drawing Types Extracted:
  - P&ID: 5 drawings
  - Plans: 5 drawings
  - Detail: 8 drawings
  - Schedule: 2 drawings
  - Block Flow: 1 drawing
  - Notes: 1 drawing

Missing Drawing Types for Full Analysis:
  - Isometrics (for weld/material verification)
  - Loop diagrams (for instrument verification)
  - Electrical drawings (for power/control verification)
  - Structural drawings (for support verification)
  - More complete P&ID set

Confidence Assessment:
  - Material conflict analysis: HIGH confidence (no conflicts in extracted data)
  - Size conflict analysis: MEDIUM confidence (limited line coverage)
  - Equipment tag analysis: HIGH confidence (comprehensive for extracted drawings)
  - Instrument loop analysis: LOW confidence (missing loop diagrams)
  - Cross-discipline analysis: LOW confidence (single discipline extracted)


CONFLICT RESOLUTION TRACKING
