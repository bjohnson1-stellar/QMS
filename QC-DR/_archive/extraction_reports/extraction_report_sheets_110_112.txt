SUPPORT TYPE DETAILS
--------------------
All support types reference detail sheet R50211 (Sheet 49 in database).
Support specifications from R50211:

Type J - Clevis Hanger
  Member Type: clevis
  Member Size: Anvil Fig. 260
  Rod Size: Variable
  Notes: Galvanized steel, with insulation shield for insulated pipe

Type K - Trapeze Hanger (2-Rod)
  Note: Type K is not explicitly defined in the R50211 detail data.
  This appears to be a general reference to Detail 3 trapeze hangers.
  Likely refers to one of types N-U based on load requirements.

Type L - Support
  Note: Type L is not explicitly defined in the R50211 detail data.
  May be a custom or site-specific support detail.

Available Trapeze Hanger Types (from R50211):
  Type N: L2x2x1/4 angle, 500 lbs, 1/2" rod, 4' span
  Type P: L3x3x1/4 angle, 1200 lbs, 1/2" rod, 4' span
  Type Q: L4x4x1/4 angle, 2000 lbs, 1/2" rod, 4' span
  Type R: L4x4x3/8 angle, 2900 lbs, 5/8" rod, 4' span
  Type S: L4x4x1/4 angle B2B, 4100 lbs, 7/8" rod, 4' span
  Type T: L4x4x3/8 angle B2B, 6000 lbs, 1" rod, 4' span
  Type U: L5x5x3/8 angle B2B, 9500 lbs, 1 1/8" rod, 4' span

DATABASE RECORDS
----------------
All extracted data has been inserted into the quality.db database:

Tables Updated:
  - sheets: Metadata updated for sheets 110, 111, 112
    - drawing_number, title, revision
    - drawing_type = 'support_plan'
    - complexity = 'medium'
    - quality_score = 0.86-0.88
    - extraction_model = 'claude-sonnet-4.5'
    - extracted_at = current timestamp

  - support_details: 5 records inserted
    - Sheet 110: 1 record (Type K x36)
    - Sheet 111: 1 record (Type K x61)
    - Sheet 112: 3 records (Type J x13, Type K x1, Type L x1)

EXTRACTION METHOD
-----------------
1. PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF (fitz)
2. Pattern matching for support references:
   - Format: R50211 [newline] 3 [newline] [TYPE_LETTER]
   - Also handled typo: R5211 (missing zero)
3. Counting occurrences of each support type per sheet
4. Cross-referencing with detail sheet R50211 (Sheet 49)
5. High confidence (0.95) due to clear, standardized reference format

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
---------------------
High Confidence (0.95) for extracted data because:
  - Clear, standardized support reference format
  - Explicit references to detail sheet R50211
  - Pattern matching with multiple occurrences provides validation
  - Text extraction quality is good (2106-3043 characters per sheet)

Moderate Confidence (0.86-0.88) for overall sheet quality:
  - Support types K and L not found in R50211 reference data
  - May require manual verification of detail callouts
  - Title extraction shows all as "FLOOR AREA 4" (may be metadata issue)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Verify Type K and Type L definitions on physical drawings
2. Cross-check support locations on plan views for accuracy
3. Confirm title blocks show correct floor area numbers (4, 5, 6)
4. Review detail sheet R50211 for any missing type definitions
5. Consider extracting grid coordinates for support locations

NOTES
-----
- These are plan view drawings showing support locations
- Each support location references a detail on sheet R50211
- The number "3" in references indicates "Detail 3" on R50211
- Support type letters (J, K, L) specify the support configuration
- Most supports are Type K trapeze hangers (98 of 112 locations)
- Clevis hangers (Type J) used in 13 locations on Sheet 112
