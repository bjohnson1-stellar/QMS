  - System designations: HTRS (hot return suction), HTRL (hot return liquid),
    HG (hot gas), DC (defrost condensate), EQ (equalization)

Controllers:
  - DANFOSS ICF4S controllers (smaller units)
  - DANFOSS ICF6S controllers (larger units)
  - PI (pressure indicators) noted at multiple locations

Applications:
  - Primary Packaging: 124.0 TR cooling capacity (RMAU5-106-1)
  - Secondary Packaging: 21.4 TR per unit (AHU6-109-4, AHU6-109-5)
  - Corridor cooling: 8.3 TR

Line Numbering System:
  - Format: [SHEET]-[SEQ]-[SERVICE]
  - Example: R70016-56-HTRL = Sheet R70016, sequence 56, Hot Return Liquid
  - Cross-references to other sheets noted (R70013, R70022)

RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Cross-reference validation: Verify line numbers R70013-59/60/61 and
   R70022-71/72/73 match the referenced sheets when they are extracted.

2. Consider extracting the remaining sheets in the R70013 and R70022 series
   to complete the refrigeration system documentation.

3. The high confidence scores indicate the extraction can be trusted, but
   recommend spot-checking 5-10 items against the original drawings.

4. Control valve settings (fail position, control range) were not visible
   in the P&IDs. Consider extracting this data from specification sheets
   or valve data sheets if available.

5. NDE requirements and weld details are not applicable to P&IDs. These
   would be found on isometric drawings if needed for this project.
