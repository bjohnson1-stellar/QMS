EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
Approach: Vision-based extraction from PDF drawings

Process:
  1. Convert PDF to high-resolution PNG (2x zoom)
  2. Analyze drawing layout and identify drawing type
  3. Extract refrigeration lines with size, material, service, routing
  4. Extract equipment tags and descriptions
  5. Extract instrument tags and types
  6. Assign confidence scores based on clarity and legibility
  7. Store structured data in SQLite database
  8. Update sheet metadata with extraction timestamp and metrics

Confidence Scoring:
  Base: 0.70 - 0.90
  Factors:
    + Clear text and standard formats
    + Consistent with refrigeration engineering practices
    + High resolution and good color separation
    - Partially obscured text
    - Non-standard labeling
    - Lower resolution areas

================================================================================
OBSERVATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Data Quality:
  - High quality extractions overall (avg 0.82)
  - Sheet 11 (Area 8) shows highest quality due to clear mechanical room layout
  - Sheet 12 (Area 10) slightly lower due to fewer reference points
  - All confidence scores above 0.70 threshold

Completeness:
  - All major piping runs identified
  - All visible equipment tags captured
  - Instrument tags captured where legible
  - Title blocks confirm drawing numbers and revisions

Suggested Follow-up:
  1. Cross-reference equipment tags with equipment schedules
  2. Verify pipe sizes against refrigeration load calculations
  3. Check instrument loop numbers against I/O schedules
  4. Review connection points between different area drawings
  5. Validate refrigerant service types against system design

Next Steps:
  - Process remaining refrigeration drawings (other floor areas)
  - Extract roof plan and interstitial drawings
  - Build complete refrigeration system database
  - Cross-check for tag conflicts or duplicates
  - Generate refrigeration line list and equipment index
