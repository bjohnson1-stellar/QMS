ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

DRAWING TYPE CLASSIFICATION:
These are CONSTRUCTION DETAIL drawings, not equipment or piping design drawings.
They contain:
  1. Standard construction practices and procedures
  2. Installation details and specifications
  3. Generic reference examples (not specific equipment tags)
  4. Contractor notes and requirements

EXTRACTION LIMITATIONS:
- Detail drawings typically do not contain equipment tags, line numbers, or
  weld schedules like P&IDs, isometrics, or equipment plans do
- Text extraction found minimal equipment references (only generic "AHU" in
  example details)
- For project-specific equipment data, refer to:
  * P&ID drawings (process equipment and instrumentation)
  * Equipment layout plans (equipment locations and tags)
  * Isometric drawings (piping and weld details)
  * Equipment schedules and line lists

EXTRACTION METHOD:
Used text-based pattern matching with PyMuPDF due to lack of API access.
This method:
  + Successfully extracts text from PDF drawings
  + Uses regex patterns to identify equipment tags, line numbers, instruments
  - Less effective on detail drawings which have narrative text vs tagged items
  - Cannot interpret visual elements like symbols or diagrams

For better results on detail drawings, consider:
  - Vision-based extraction using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with image input
  - OCR with layout analysis to understand drawing structure
  - Manual review for construction notes and requirements

QUALITY SCORES:
- Sheet 43: 0.50 (minimal extractable data, general construction details)
- Sheet 44: 0.70 (some equipment references in example details)
- Sheet 45: 0.70 (some equipment references in example details)

Lower scores reflect the nature of detail drawings rather than extraction
quality issues.

DATABASE UPDATES
================================================================================

The following tables were updated in D:/quality.db:

sheets table:
  - Set extracted_at timestamp
  - Set extraction_model = 'text-pattern-match'
  - Set quality_score
  - Set drawing_type = 'detail'
  - Set complexity ('simple' or 'medium')

equipment table:
  - Inserted 2 equipment items (Sheet 44 and 45)
  - Both are generic AHU references from detail examples

lines table:
  - No insertions (no line numbers in detail drawings)

instruments table:
  - No insertions (no instrument tags in detail drawings)

welds table:
  - No insertions (no weld schedules in detail drawings)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

For comprehensive project data extraction:

1. P&ID Drawings - Extract equipment tags, instruments, control valves, line
   numbers, and process flow information

2. Isometric Drawings - Extract line numbers, weld details, dimensions, and
   material specifications

3. Equipment Plans/Layouts - Extract equipment tags, locations, elevations,
   and spatial relationships

4. Line Lists - Extract comprehensive piping data including sizes, materials,
   specifications, and routing

5. Equipment Schedules - Extract equipment specifications, capacities, and
   manufacturer information

Detail drawings like these (R50012, R50100, R50101) should be indexed for
reference but are not primary sources for equipment/piping data extraction.
